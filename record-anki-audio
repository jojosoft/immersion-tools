# Requires sox, xclip and bc to be installed on the system.
# If you are not on KDE, replace kdialog commands with your preference.
# Please change at least $COLLECTION to point to your Anki collection.

# When executed, the script will use sox to record an audio source.
# When executed again, the script will stop the recording and export it.
# It will be saved as a 128k MP3 file and moved to your Anki collection.
# Finally, "[sound:filename.mp3]" will be copied to your clipboard.
# (Ready for pasting it directly into the audio field on an Anki card.)

# To setup this script to record the correct source, execute it once.
# Then set the desired source in the PulseAudio control panel for sox.
# Execute the script once more to stop the test recording again.
# PulseAudio should now always provide the desired source to sox.
# If you are not using PulseAudio, specifiy the desired ALSA device.
# (You will have to look up the syntax of the rec command to do this.)

# The minimum required length of a recording in milliseconds.
# Stopping the recording will not possible before this time passed.
# Also the duration that the script will block after a recording.
# Both is to prevent problems due to long or repeated key presses.
